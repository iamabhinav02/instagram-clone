# instagram-clone
#### (an ongoing project)

An attempt to make a clone of Instagram with all the functionality of Instagram (obviously not all ðŸ˜…) created from scratch using MERN tech stack.

Functionality includes:
```
1. signup
2. login, logout
3. create, delete posts
4. follow, unfollow user
5. update profile picture
6. like, unlike posts
7. add, delete comments
8. view user profile
9. view posts of following people
10. navigation bar
```

To run the app on localhost:

1. Download the zipped folder/ clone the project on your system
2. Open cmd in the same location
3. Type 
```
cd server
npm install
    
cd client
npm install
```
These commands will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

4. to run the app,
First run your server using
```
cd server
npm start
```
Then run your client side using
```
cd client
npm start
```

Will soon host the running application on any cloud service provider like Herokuapp.

Do let me know how you liked the application ðŸš€ðŸš€

Cheers ðŸ•º

Link for the live website - https://clone-insta-gram.herokuapp.com

An attempt to make a clone of Instagram with all the functionality of Instagram (obviously not all ðŸ˜…) created from scratch using MERN tech stack.

In this project, I covered:

1.  Building an backend API with Node.js & Express
2.  Testing API using Postman
3.  JWT based authentication and encrypting password
4.  Image upload on database like cloudinary
5.  Context API for state management
6.  React Hooks
7.  React Router hooks
8.  Protecting routes or endpoints
9.  Sending Emails
10. Forgot & Reset Password

Functionalities included:

```
1.  signup
2.  login, logout
3.  create, delete posts
4.  follow, unfollow user
5.  update profile picture
6.  like, unlike posts
7.  add, delete comments
8.  view user profile
9.  view posts of following people
10. navigation bar
11. search user bar
12. forgot and reset password
13. sending email
14. showing latest posts on top
```

To run the app on localhost:

1. Download the zipped folder/ clone the project on your system
2. Open cmd in the same location
3. Type

```
npm install

cd client
npm install
```

These commands will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

4. to run the app,
   First run your server using

```
npm start
```

Then run your client side using

```
cd client
npm start
```

Do let me know how you liked the application ðŸš€ðŸš€
